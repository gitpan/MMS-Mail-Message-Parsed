NAME
    MMS::Mail::Message::Parsed - A class representing a parsed MMS (or
    picture) message, that has been parsed by an MMS::Mail::Provider class.

VERSION
    Version 0.06

SYNOPSIS
    This class is used by MMS::Mail::Parser to provide a final data storage
    class after the MMS has been parsed by the MMS::Mail::Provider class. It
    inherits from the MMS::Mail::Message class and extends it's methods to
    allow access to parsed properties.

METHODS
    The MMS::Mail::Message::Parsed class inherits all the methods from it's
    parent class MMS::Mail::Message.

  Constructor
    "new()"
        Return a new MMS::Mail::Message::Parsed object.

  Regular Methods
    "add_image" MIME::Entity
        Instance method - Adds the supplied MIME::Entity attachment to the
        image stack for the message. This method is mainly used by the
        MMS::Mail::Provider class to add images while parsing.

    "add_video" MIME::Entity
        Instance method - Adds the supplied MIME::Entity attachment to the
        video stack for the message. This method is mainly used by the
        MMS::Mail::Provider class to add videos while parsing.

    "images"
        Instance method - Returns an array reference to an array of images
        from the message.

    "videos"
        Instance method - Returns an array reference to an array of videos
        from the message.

    "phone_number" STRING
        Instance method - Returns the MMS mobile number the message was sent
        from when invoked with no supplied parameter. When supplied with a
        parameter it sets the object property to the supplied parameter.
        This property is not set by the MMS::Mail::Provider class but is set
        by it's subclasses.

    "retrieve_attachments" STRING
        Instance method - Expects a mime-type to be passed as an argument
        and a regular expression match using the supplied string is applied
        to each attachment in the attachment stack of the message object and
        a reference to an array of objects where the mime-type matches the
        supplied string is returned. In the event no attachment was matched
        to the supplied mime-type an undef value is returned.
